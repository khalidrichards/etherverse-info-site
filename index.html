      <h2>About the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Etherverse is a fantasy card game combining some traditional trading card gameplay with more tactical elements. Players take
        the role of a Party Leader, recruiting party members, moving around the field, and performing actions to accomplish one of two
        objectives: achieve their goal or stop the opposing Party Leader from achieving theirs.

      <h2>Where the Game's At Now</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, Etherverse is still under development! At the moment, it's mostly a solo project
        (made by <a href="https://www.khalidmrich.com" target="_blank">Khalid Richards</a>), but that doesn't stop me from getting others
        involved! I'm always looking for playtesters, artists, and feedback! If you're interested in any way, definitely feel free to
        reach out via the Discord or Instagram!
      </p><br>

      <h2>A Note on AI Use</h2>
      <p>
        Observant eyes may notice that the game uses some AI art assets. <b>I want to stress these are placeholders for now.</b>
        As someone that has many talents that don't particularly include art, I mainly use AI to help me bridge any skill gaps and
        start conversations with folks that have the talents I need to make the game look as good as it plays. Rest assured that this is an
        important part of the Etherverse roadmap that I hope to figure out sooner than later!
